I have been fascinated by news aggregation for 10 years and trying to understand news algorithmically and how it propagates around the world. \r\n\r\nI had a few attempts at building RSS feed readers over the years but turns out its a really hard problem to do this at scale and needs machine learning to do this properly.\r\n\r\nI really liked Twitter but its impossible to track numerous topics at scale and its so noisy, its hard to discover new blogs or stories about your topics.\r\n\r\nBoth Google News & Feedly lack a way to discover new content or sites on specific topics.\r\nLinkedin is only as good as your network and tend to have opinion or expertise related articles and Facebook really sucks at topics and they only want to show sites if they get paid.\r\n\r\n## What now?\r\n\r\nWe have a few team members in Australia, Columbia, Vietnam, Pakistan and China and have self funded. \r\n\r\nWe plan to offer a premium model in the next few months most probably around pushing topic streams to Slack or FB Messenger or sharing via Buffer or Hootsuite, but for now we are very focused on keeping the crawlers running and making it super useful to you.\r\n\r\nThe only thing we want is feedback and suggestions as to features to make it more useful. Let us know if there is something you want us to build.\r\n\r\n## What's with the Monkey?\r\n\r\nThe monkey is called Harry, I ran a logo design competition and the smart looking Monkey face with the glasses reminded me of my two Nephews Hylton and Harry so I had to adopt it :)\r\n\r\nWe also have another trained Monkey called Dyson (like the cleaner), Dyson's job is to vacuum all your tweets up so we can use ML (Monkey Learning) to work out what topics you like and then build you a custom feed of stories that match the topics you are interested in.",
